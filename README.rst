Introduction
============

Logic for how to load .groovy files and execute them; allowing replacing methods, catching missing methods, referencing each other and passing parameters up and down, etc.

Note: the structure of the directories is add-hoc (ala Jenkins shared pipelines style), but other structures will work

Quickstart
==========
